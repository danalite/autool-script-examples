## Web App Wrappers

### Todo list
- Example of wrapping a Todo list web app using AuTool, and use APIs to update the todo list.

- Personally speaking, I do not like to open and close Todo app back and forth while working; this makes me lose focus. 

- Here is what I want: (1) when I hit a hotkey, I will be asked to input a todo item, select tags, and the item is submitted to my Todo list app running remotely (2) when I finish a todo item, I hit the hotkey and check one pending items(3) I do not want the app running in the background all the time, eating up my memory.
