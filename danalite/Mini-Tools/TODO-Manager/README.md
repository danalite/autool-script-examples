## TODO Manager
- A minimal text-based todo manager that saves the TODO tasks in text format, without any other heavyweight database. 

- UI is powered by AuTool Canvas, which prettier than CLI, tho less powerful than other TODO solutions.

- You always have the option to use the original todo.txt-cli, but this script is more convenient to use.

## Prerequisites
- Install todo.txt-cli before using this script
  
```bash
# On MacOS
brew install todo-txt
cp /usr/local/opt/todo-txt/todo.cfg ~/.todo.cfg
```

- Tabs: new tasks (with existing, many inputs, can be added/deleted) + View finished tasks (search with +/@)
