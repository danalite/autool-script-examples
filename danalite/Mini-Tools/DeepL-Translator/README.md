## Pre-requisites
- We use DeepLX library to get translation from 

```shell
# https://github.com/OwO-Network/DeepLX

# Set up the docker API service
docker run -itd -p 1188:1188 ghcr.io/owo-network/deeplx:latest
```

## Usage
We use the same UI as interactive chatbot, but with a different backend. Basically, it is like your chatting with a translator, which translates your input as the reply.
